# Life360 Py: A Vibe Coding Productivity Project

## What is this?
This is a vibe coding project—a custom productivity tool built with Python and Tkinter, designed to fit my unique workflow and needs.

### Inspiration
Every productivity system has failed me. I don't even remember all the ones I used to use (Notion, Obsidian, Google Docs, tons of paper lists). So vibe coding lets me create something custom tailored to my specific needs while also learning a new skill. Yes, vibe coding takes a lot of the critical thinking out of it, but the gain is speed and iteration. I'm still learning.

## App Overview
The app is organized into four main tabs:

### 1. Dashboard
- **Life Priorities:** Write and review your top priorities in areas like career, health, finances, religion, relationships, and hobbies.
- **Daily Affirmations:** Store and update your daily affirmations for motivation and focus.
- *(Vision Board section is planned for future updates.)*

### 2. Tasks
- **Today's Tasks:** Add, complete, and delete tasks for the current day.
- **Task Backlog:** Maintain a backlog of tasks, move them to daily, complete, or delete them as needed.

### 3. Weekly Planning
- **Weekly View:** Plan your week with a column for each day (Monday–Sunday). Set the week start date, and quickly switch between weeks.
- **Autosave:** Changes are saved automatically as you type.

### 4. Journal
- **Daily Reflection:** Write a journal entry for each day.
- **AI Feedback:** Get simple feedback on your reflection, with suggestions and encouragement.
- **History:** Browse and load previous journal entries.

This project is a living experiment in building my own productivity system, iterating quickly, and learning as I go. If you want to try it, clone the repo and run `python index.py` from the `life360_py` directory.
